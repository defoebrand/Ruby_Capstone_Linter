# Ruby Capstone Project (Ruby Linter)

This is Brandon's Ruby Capstone project

This project was compiled by Brandon in the Ruby section of the Microverse course work as the Ruby capstone project. It involved building a linter from scratch to create a real-world-like project.

This linter performs the following tests:



###### Trailing Whitespace:

##### Excess Whitespace:

##### Empty Lines:

##### Missing Closing Statement:

##### Incorrect Capitalization of Reserved Word:

##### Missing Matching Bracket:

Particularly noteworthy is the active error correction for when one error comes up because of the existence of another, as in the case of lines 18 and 19 where it appears as two empty lines. With error correction it registers a missing closing statement and what should be an empty line once that closing statement is added, without error correction it would register as two extraneous empty lines and a missing closing statement.
